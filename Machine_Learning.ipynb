        "\n",
        "**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** is a crucial step in the data science workflow because it helps you **understand** and **prepare** the data for modeling. Without EDA, your model may be inaccurate or inefficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s why EDA is important before fitting a model:\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. **Understand the Data**\n",
        "   - **Identify the types of variables**: Are they continuous or categorical? This helps you decide on preprocessing steps (like encoding or scaling).\n",
        "   - **Understand the relationships between features**: Are any features correlated? Are there outliers? These insights guide you in feature selection and transformation.\n",
        "   - **Distribution**: Check the distribution of features (e.g., normal, skewed). This can affect your choice of model or the need for transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. **Detect and Handle Missing Values**\n",
        "   - **Missing data** can skew the model’s performance if not handled properly.\n",
        "   - EDA allows you to identify missing values and decide how to handle them: filling with the mean/median, using a prediction model, or removing rows/columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. **Identify Outliers**\n",
        "   - **Outliers** can distort results, especially for algorithms sensitive to them (like linear regression or k-means clustering).\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",

        "   - **Create new features** based on existing ones that might be more informative for the model.\n",
        "   - EDA often reveals relationships or patterns that you can exploit (e.g., extracting the year from a date, encoding categorical variables).\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",

        "   - Understand the **distribution** and check if it’s skewed, imbalanced, or requires transformation.\n",

        "\n",
        "### 7. **Better Data Preprocessing**\n",

        "   - For example, you might need to:\n",
        "     - Scale features if they have different units (e.g., salary in thousands, age in years).\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. **Detect Data Quality Issues**\n",
        "   - EDA helps you spot any **data issues** such as duplicate entries, incorrect values, or inconsistencies.\n",
        "   - Addressing these before training ensures that the model isn’t misled by bad data.\n",

The main difference from **Batch Gradient Descent** is that it updates the parameters using only a **single data point** (or a small batch) at each iteration.\n",
